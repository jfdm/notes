# Notes on Programming Language Theory.

This repository represents the source code for a project to document *my* notes on programming language theory.

Rather than doing everything in LaTeX (which *does* give you cool looking notes), I am taking a mechanical verification approach and using the dependently-typed language Idris2 to mechanise the concepts.
Building upon Idris2's literate mode also allows me to use [jupyter-book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) to create literate notes.

This is a work in progress, so there will be changes.
